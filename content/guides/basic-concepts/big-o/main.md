title: "Big O"
---
<br>

Big O is a measurement used to assess the efficiency of an algorithm for both time and memory complexity.

It represents the algorithm's performance in the "worst case" scenario.

## O(1)
Single definitions, comparisons, computations, etc.

Generally used for algorithms with constant time/memory complexity.

```cpp
int a = 2;
// or
if(a==2) return 2;
// or
int b = a+2;
```

## O(log N)

## O(N)

<br>

## O(N log N)
<br>
<br>

## O(N^2)
<br>
<br>

## O(2^N)

<br>

## O(N!)
