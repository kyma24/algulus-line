## Trees
<br>

Trees are a restrained form of graphs.

- Every tree has a root ("source") node.
- Every child must have one parent (except for the root, which has none).
- Every parent may or may not have multiple children.
- No cycles. Assuming that the tree is fully connected, if it has V vertices, it must have V-1 edges.
